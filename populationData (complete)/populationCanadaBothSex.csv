Footnotes:
1,Postcensal estimates are based on the 2016 Census counts adjusted for census net undercoverage (CNU) (including adjustment for incompletely enumerated Indian reserves (IEIR)) and the components of demographic growth that occurred since that census. Intercensal estimates are produced using counts from two consecutive censuses adjusted for CNU (including (IEIR) and postcensal estimates.
2,"Estimates are final intercensal up to 2015, final postcensal for 2016, updated postcensal for 2017 and 2018 and preliminary postcensal for 2019."
3,Data for persons aged 90 to 100 years and over will be available from 2001.
